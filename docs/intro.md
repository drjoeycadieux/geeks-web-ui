# Introduction to Geeks ui

Let's get started with **Geeks UI**.

## Getting Started

Get started by adding cdn link in the **head** of your html.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Creating a new ui with

creating a ui with geeks ui site using the **html template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```cdn link
 https://geeks-ui-cdn.netlify.app/build/cdn/v1/geeks_ui.min.css
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Preview your site

open the development server:

```bash
https://localhost:3000
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created geeks ui site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `open server` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
